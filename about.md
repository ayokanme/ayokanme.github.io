************************************What is in a name?************************************

My name, Ayo-kan-mi, translates to joy-(hath)-touched-me. Iâ€™m very curious, and it brings me joy anytime I learn something new. How do things work; Why do things exist; Where do things come from? This site is my attempt to document some of my thoughts as I learn new things.
