The year is 2020. After what had been a tumultuous twelve months, I finally made up my mind to focus my career efforts elsewhere. It wouldn’t be the first time I changed directions. I moved to the US to become a pilot and ended up spending 10 years in the earth sciences — geology then petrophysics.

Being stuck at home for months on end came with enough challenges, but it was a great time for introspection. I wasn’t certain what I wanted to do, but I was clear on what I didn’t want anymore. Slowness, bureaucracy, lack of innovation, monotony. In fact, I thought the subsurface work we were doing could use two-thirds fewer people if we focused on automating some core tasks.  

I made up my mind to leave. One problem though, where to this time?  

I considered the usual oil and gas exit routes—banking and consulting—but both of them ticked boxes I was trying to avoid.  

Then I realized the answer was in all the exploration I was doing in my free time. I was always interested in how things got built and how they worked. Naturally, I found myself spending a lot of my time immersed in the history of the technologies that power our everyday life. From electricity to the telegraph and telephone, to computers and the internet. A few things they had in common stood out to me.

~code in nature img \composed of elements described below\~

Code is often unrecognizable because it is simple and concise. Some examples of code in nature and everyday life:

[Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is used in communication in a multitude of mediums.  
The [Dewey decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) is used in libraries.  
The [punch card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) was used in early computing.  
[Binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) is used in computer systems.  
The [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) classifies elements into periods and groups.  
The calendar is used to tell the time of year--using solar- and lunar-based calculations.  
The [decimal number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) is used to describe quantities.  
Languages are a series of codes used to encode information in oral or written communication.
