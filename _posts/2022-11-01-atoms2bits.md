The year is 2020. After what had been a tumultuous twelve months, I finally made up my mind to focus my career efforts elsewhere. It wouldn’t be the first time I changed directions. I moved to the US to become a pilot and ended up spending 10 years in the earth sciences — geology then petrophysics.

Being stuck at home for months on end came with enough challenges, but it was a great time for introspection. I wasn’t certain what I wanted to do, but I was clear on what I didn’t want anymore. Slowness, bureaucracy, lack of innovation, monotony. In fact, I thought the subsurface work we were doing could use two-thirds fewer people if we focused on automating some core tasks.  

I made up my mind to leave. One problem though, where to this time?  

I considered the usual oil and gas exit routes—banking and consulting—but both of them ticked boxes I was trying to avoid.  

Then I realized the answer was in all the exploration I was doing in my free time. I was always interested in how things got built and how they worked. Naturally, I found myself spending a lot of my time immersed in the history of the technologies that power our everyday life. From electricity to the telegraph and telephone, to computers and the internet. A few things they had in common stood out to me.  

**Ubiquity**  

~code in nature img \composed of elements described below\~  

[Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) encodes text characters using a combination of long and short signals.  

Librarians use the [Dewey decimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification) to organize and retireve items in their collections.  

Early computers were operated using the [punch card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).  

Modern computer systems use [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) to encode instructions and data.  

Elements are classified into periods and groups by the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table). These periods and groups describe their atomic size, metallic character, electron size, and valency.  

Most civilizations tell the time of year using solar- or lunar-based calendars.  

The [decimal number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) is used to describe quantities.  

Languages encode information for oral or written communication.  

Code is everywhere.  


**Composability**

Information that can be represented by a finite set of primitives (symbols) can be recomposed.  
  
Computers perform [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)) using a series of electrical switches (XOR, AND, & OR) to handle summation and overflow. The recomposition of these primitives allows for the computation of subtractions and multiplications.

Telegraphy is a composition of signals transmitted using visual, auditory, or electrical means.

The internet is a composition of networked computers interacting using a series of protocols. DNS, FTP, HTTP/S, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, POP, PTP, RTP, SIP, SMTP, SSH, TLS/SSL, TOR, and many others.

DNA is the most complex program. Four primitives (nucleotide bases) are responsible for the unique cellular expressions of the over 100 billion humans that have ever lived.

**Leverage**

I was sufficiently familiar with the two historic forms of productivity leverage—labor and capital. Creating value by leveraging labor requires the coercion of people (with money or the threat of violence) to do productive work. Capital refers to resources such as money, property, or machinery. It can be allocated to produce goods or services.  

The challenge with labor and capital is their cost of replication increases linearly. Having labor does not cheapen the cost of additional labor, the same is true for capital (under most circumstances). In essence, permission is required to leverage labor and capital at scale.  

Content and code are permissionless.  

If I had a great singing voice, I could stand in the middle of a public square and sing to everyone within earshot. I could even record my performance, upload it to YouTube, and profit from it whenever someone watches it.

Alternatively, assume I have an idea for a better video hosting site than YouTube. I could write the code for the new site, put it online, and take all of YouTube's customers. Theoretically, of course.  

The internet makes code and content truly permissionless forms of productivity leverage by offering instantaneous, global reach (streaming, social media, and cloud computing). All at very trivial scaling costs.

Ultimately, the choice was between sticking with what had worked well for me and swimming towards something that offered ubiquity, composability, and infinite leverage. I needed to be fair to my future self by not limiting future opportunities because of assumptions that no longer held true.  


_**Notes**_
1. American innovations
2. Hacking
3. Aristotle invented the Computer
4. what cultures don't use solar or lunar calendars? if none, fix calendars above
5. Genetic code is borne of a combination of 4 nucleotide bases. These bases encode all the information required to build and maintain an organism. The key to its complexity and efficiency is its composability. From just four bases it can be combined in almost limitless ways to create an astounding variety of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies, each with a specific function.
6. Content is the colloquial term for information or entertainment. Think text (articles and books), audio (songs, podcasts, or audiobooks), imagery, and video. Media of distribution is quite important as well. Historically, content replication required physical mediums. Paper for writing, vinyl records for audio, canvas for imagery, and film for video. The replication cost for a CD was the price of a blank CD (and its labeling). No matter how cheap a CD is, the cost scales linearly as more CDs are printed. The same artist only requires one copy of an MP3 for unlimited online downloads or streaming.
