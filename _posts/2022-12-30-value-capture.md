This tweet popped up on my timeline 6 months ago. The journey looks incredibly inefficient. But I assume it is profitable since this supply chain was set up by rational economic actors. The interesting thing about this process is that the folks making the largest margins in this operation do the least amount of dirty work.

Societies develop by capturing most of the value they create, which improves their quality of life. Governments can turbocharge value capture by taxing and regulating economic activities, as well as directing public investments.

But for some reason, the same thing happens over[^1]

and over

**Why capture value?**

Value-creating activities beget value-creating activities. Ecosystems form around it. People build new tools to exploit it. People swarm to make a living engaging in it. Value creation compounds and the ecosystem discovers new value-creating activities to engage in.

Information asymmetry also plays a role in preventing value capture. Think of this. LVMH patronizes tanneries in Northern Nigeria for their leather supplies. LVMH is a known entity, the tanneries are not. Nothing prevents an enterprising individual from building a plant near the same tannery and producing goods of the same quality (stitching and cutting are not rocket science), except for the uncertainty associated with doing business in Nigeria.

For the longest time, I used to believe the trope “Africa is the wealthiest continent.” Is it? Nigeria, with it's abundance of natural resources was very recently named the “poverty capital of the world.” The DRC has the largest cobalt deposits in the world. Contrast it with where the cobalt is eventually used. Who is wealthier?

Four countries in the world capture half of the value created on earth, annually. Japan makes the cut without any significant natural resources to boast of. The things they have in common are robust manufacturing bases, political stability, and rule of law.

Without those ingredients, you get situations like this[^2]

Why did I write this? Mainly because it’s been stuck in my head and I see it everywhere I turn. Or maybe it’s because of my 2023 resolution. To be continued.

**_Notes:_**

[^1]: Recently, there’s been articles in the news [ghana cocoa, zim, nigeria, drc] emphasizing that foreign companies need to set up processing facilities in-country if they want to continue to access certain resources. I think the spirit is great. but are the systems set up to capture and compound the value that will arise from these changes? The jury is still out.

[^2]: Watching the FIFA Uncovered documentary (Netflix [link]) was pretty sad. Not necessarily because it confirmed what we knew about corruption in world football. Other countries signed deals for gas to provide energy and and warm their homes in the winter. Meanwhile, the African delegates traded their votes for orders of magnitude less than their European counterparts. Not only that, the trade only benefitted the few people close to the voting. When your systems are not set up for capturing value for the society, it’s called corruption. When they are, it’s called lobbying. I know which one of the evils I prefer.
